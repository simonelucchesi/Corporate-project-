    "In this section we will analyse how to determine a consistent way of measuring risk in firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Risk refers to the likelihood we (as investors) will receive a return on a given investment that is different from the expected one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of equity valuation, according to DCF approach, _cost of equity_ is a key ingredient, but it's an implicit cost and can vary across different investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on a precise _risk and return model_ the _CAPM_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps involved** \n",
    "\n",
    "1) We will define risk in terms of the distribution of actual returns around an expected return. \n",
    "\n",
    "They may be very different from the expected one and this difference will yield risk. The spread is measured by the _variance_ (or std). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) We make a diversification between diversifiable and non diversifiable risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there is firm specific risk (project risk, competitive risk and even sector risk): it affects only a subset of entire firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "And market risk: a kind that affects many if not all investments (i.g. an in increase in interest rates). \n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding our investment portfolio allows us to diversify it, to reduce the exposure of firm specific risk. In fact, in this way every component will have in percentage a smaller impact on overall return. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the effects of this kind of risk could be positive or negative: in very large portfolio its average impact will tend to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the effects of market wide movements are likely to be in the same directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Assume we are marginal investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model look at risk through the eyes of the marginal investor: a well diversified agent; the only risk he cares is the risk addesd on to a diversified portfolio, the market risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },

    "**Capital asset pricing model: outlines** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different models for measuring market risk, we will use the capital asset pricing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Key assumptions_ : there are no transaction costs and investors have no access to private information (which would allow them to find over and under -valued stocks). This assumes away the reasosn why investors stop diversifying: in this way it ensures investors will keep diversifying until they hold a piece of every traded asset (the market portfolio) and will differ only in terms of how much their wealth they invest in this. \n",
    "\n",
    "It follow that the risk of any asset becomes the risk that it adds to the market portfolio: if an asset tends to be correlated with market portfolio in movements (not independent) it will add risk to the market portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistically, we can measure the risk added by an asset by its covariance with that portfolio: if we standardize this percentage value by dividing with variance of the market portfolio (of the average asset) we will obtain the **Beta**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_{t}$ = $\\frac{Cov_{i,m}}{\\sigma^2_{m}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beta represents sintetically the exposure of an asset to all market risk: for example the riskless asset will have beta of 0 (it should have zero variance, actual returns equal to expected ones) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously does it at a cost: making very restrictive assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the risk models (CAPM, APM and other multi-factor models) assume that only market risk is rewarded deriving the expected return as a function of measures of this risk. \n",
    "In fact, the difference between a \"simple\" CAPM and an APM is given by the fact that in the latter more than one (market) risk sources are assumed (so-called _risk factos_) allowing the analysed asset to have different exposures (betas). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros** In general, the CAPM (against APM and multi-factor models) has the advantage of being a simpler model to estimate, but it will under perform the richer APM when an investment is sensitive to economic factors not well represented in the market index. \n",

The rationale of this choice lays in the fact that risk aversion of the average investor changes over time and more recent time period provides more updated estimate.

    "**2)** Choice of risk free security: for consistency reasons we will consider the same risk free rate obtained for computing expected returns on the stock. \n",

    "- 3) The firm's financial leverage \n",
    "\n",
    "Ceteris paribus, an increase in financial leverage will increase the **equity beta** (which is different from _asset/unlevered beta_) of a firm: high leverage increases the variance in earnings per share (due to interest payments) making the equity investment riskier. \n",

    "2) Use sectors average betas: [from Damodaran's database](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/) we can find useful proxies in order to compute a better Bottom up Beta. **Notice** due to the fact the unlevered beta obtained for a business may be affected by cash holdings of firms in the comparable firms' list we will use the adjusted version for cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Unlevered beta of the specific firm: weighted average of the unlevered betas of business it operates in with weights the proportion of firm value derived from each business (we will refer to revenues for every business units). This operation yields to the bottom-up unlevered beta. \n",
